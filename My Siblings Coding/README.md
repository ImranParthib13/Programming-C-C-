# My Sister's Coding Journey

Welcome to the coding journey of my sister, who is currently in class XII and has just started learning C programming. This folder is dedicated to her coding projects and learning resources.

Feel free to explore the contents of this folder and witness her progress as she dives deeper into the world of programming.

Happy coding!
